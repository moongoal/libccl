## Dependencies

### Build dependencies

* Cmake `>= 3.24.2`
* LLVM `>= 15.0.0`
* Ninja `>= 1.11.0`
* Conan `>= 1.55.0`

### Runtime dependencies

* XXHash `>= 0.8.1`

Runtime dependencies are, by default, managed by [Conan](https://conan.io). They are listed in the `conanfile.txt`. To build the runtime dependencies, run:

```
mkdir build

conan install -if build --build -pr:b=<YOUR_PROFILE> .
```

This will build and install the supported dependencies in the local cache.

## Building

To initialise the build system for development, run:

```
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Or with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to use the release configuration.

To build the project:

```
cmake --build build
```

## Packaging

This library can be packaged with Conan, by running:

```
    conan create -pr:b <YOUR_PROFILE> .
```

## Testing
